        <h2>WHY AM I HERE?</h2>
        <p class="about">
            This place is home for all my psychological dysfunctioning.
            <br>
            A place where I am in control, with no censorship or manupulation.
            <br>
            A place where my words don't get mixed up with noise.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
            I'm here to create a place where I can make changes,
            <br>
            and express myself without experiencing shyness or social anxiety;
            <br>
            where I can talk about myself freely without distraction;
            <br>
            a place where my voice is the only sound I can hear.
