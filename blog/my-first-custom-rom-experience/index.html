    <p>I used LineageOS 20 as a daily driver for over 3 months on my old Redmi phone. Here's my experience with custom ROMs: better performance, smooth UI, privacy, and some challenges to consider.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>After four years with my trusty Redmi phone, I decided to try something a little more adventurous: installing a custom ROM. I had previously switched the stock ROM to different regional MIUI versions (European and Indonesian) and was quite comfortable, but I had never ventured into the realm of custom ROMs. Enter <strong><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lineageos.org">LineageOS</a></strong> 20 - an open-source, ad-free, and bloatware-free custom ROM that's known for its clean UI and privacy-first features.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blogs/custom-rom/lineageos.jpg" alt="Lineage OS" /></p>
<p>This blog is a technical dive into my experience, the steps I followed, and the lessons learned along the way. If you're on the fence about switching to a custom ROM like LineageOS, this might help you decide whether it's worth the effort.</p>
<h2 id="the-basics-how-i-installed-lineageos-20-on-my-redmi-phone">The Basics: How I Installed LineageOS 20 on My Redmi Phone</h2>
<p>I won’t go into an exhaustive step-by-step guide because installation can vary greatly depending on your device. However, here's a quick overview of what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Backup everything</strong>: I made sure to back up all my important data on a computer.</li>
<li><strong>Unlock the bootloader</strong>: This is necessary for installing a custom ROM. It's a bit tricky and requires permission from your device’s manufacturer (for Xiaomi, you need to use their unlock tool).</li>
<li><strong>Downgrade MIUI (Optional)</strong>: My phone was running the latest MIUI version, which didn’t support custom recovery. I had to downgrade to a version that did, but this step might not be required for you.</li>
<li><strong>Install a custom recovery</strong>: I flashed a custom recovery from the lineageos itself.</li>
<li><strong>Flash the ROM</strong>: This involved flashing the LineageOS ROM and associated files (boot, vbmeta, dtbo, and super_empty images). Not all of these steps might be necessary, but they worked for me.</li>
<li><strong>Install LiteGApps</strong>: Since I only needed Google Maps and the Play Store from google apps, I opted for the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://litegapps.github.io/">litegapps</a> <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://litegapps.github.io/doc/litegapps_variant.html#superlite">SuperLite</a> version to minimize bloatware and google tracking.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're interested in custom ROMs, the <strong><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/">XDA Developers</a></strong> forum is a great place to start. It’s essentially a treasure trove of ROM guides and developer support.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-i-experienced-with-lineageos-20">The Benefits I Experienced with LineageOS 20</h2>
<p>Once everything was up and running, here are the key advantages I noticed immediately:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A Clean, Super Smooth UI</strong>: No bloatware, no adware—just a clean, fast UI. LineageOS was sleek, snappy, and felt like a breath of fresh air compared to the bloat-heavy stock MIUI experience.</li>
<li><strong>Nightly OTA Updates</strong>: This was a game-changer. LineageOS offers regular nightly updates, ensuring my phone stays up-to-date with the latest security patches.</li>
<li><strong>Banking and Streaming Apps Work Out of the Box</strong>: I was relieved to see that essential apps like Netflix, Google Pay, and various banking apps passed the integrity checks and worked without issues.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Privacy</strong>: One of the key reasons I switched was to minimize tracking. LineageOS offers a higher level of privacy, giving me more control over app permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Longer Battery Life</strong>: With bloatware out of the picture, I noticed improved battery life. It was a pleasant surprise, especially on a phone that was already several years old.</li>
<li><strong>More Storage</strong>: With fewer pre-installed apps and system processes, I had more free space on my device.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Satisfaction</strong>: There’s an undeniable feeling of accomplishment when you successfully install a custom ROM and enjoy a better experience on a device that’s been written off as obsolete.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="challenges-i-faced-during-the-switch">Challenges I Faced During the Switch</h2>
<p>While the experience was largely positive, there were a few hurdles along the way:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bootloader Locking Issues</strong>: One major frustration was that the bootloader could not be locked once I installed the custom ROM. Locking the bootloader requires manually compiling signed images and using a capable PC, which was beyond my setup. This also meant that Google Play’s integrity checks failed, so certain apps like <strong>Indriver</strong>, <strong>Binance</strong>, and <strong>Banana Kong 2</strong> wouldn’t install properly. I was able to sideload Indriver using the <strong><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://auroraoss.com/">Aurora Store</a></strong> APK, but other apps remained inaccessible.</li>
<li><strong>WiFi Connectivity</strong>: LineageOS had some trouble connecting to hidden WiFi networks. It took anywhere from 10-20 seconds longer to discover and connect to them, which was a bit annoying at times.</li>
<li><strong>Missing Camera Features</strong>: The default camera app from LineageOS was pretty basic. Missing features like panorama and timelapse were noticeable.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-was-it-worth-it">Final Thoughts: Was It Worth It?</h2>
<p>Despite the few challenges, my experience with LineageOS 20 was overwhelmingly positive. The performance boost, the ad-free environment, and the heightened privacy were all worth the effort. LineageOS delivered a noticeable improvement over MIUI, and the fact that my device was getting regular updates made it feel like I had a brand-new phone.</p>
<p>Even though I have since moved on to a newer device, I still use my Redmi phone as a secondary device with LineageOS. I plan to continue experimenting with custom ROMs as long as my primary phone remains unsupported or outdated.</p>
<p>For those who are tech-savvy and willing to take on the occasional challenge, a custom ROM like LineageOS is definitely worth considering. It offers a level of control and performance that’s hard to match with stock ROMs.</p>
