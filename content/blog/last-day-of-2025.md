I have been lazy and full of excuses when it came to doing the things I wanted to do. This is a reminder to myself that whenever I look at this, I’ll force myself to be who I am and do all the things I wanted to do.

I wrote zero articles in 2025. Me and my friend started some services that helps individuals and organizations solve/easier their problems and requiremnts with technology (I promise I'll reveal more about this soon in another article). We created websites, chat systems, support, and all the setups—but we didn’t focus on actual customers and services. I had some ups and downs, but now I am back with new energy, and I will at least stick to that energy.

I am a DevOps engineer, and a few things I learned and used for my projects in 2025 are Proxmox, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Ansible. I also had some amazing freelance work from around the globe.

Looking forward to not making excuses to do what I want to do, go out, meet new people, and travel to different places. Connect with people from around the globe, learn new technologies, and provide services to as many people as I can. Grateful for my time on Earth.
