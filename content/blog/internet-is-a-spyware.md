The internet, through the collection and storage of personal data by companies and governments, can be used as a tool for surveillance.

## Introduction
As a general principle, it's important to be aware that any time you use the internet, you're potentially sharing information about yourself. That being said, some companies are certainly better known for collecting and using large amounts of data about their users than others. When we talk about "big tech companies," we're typically talking about a few large corporations like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. This doesn't mean "just big tech companies collect your data" but also includes many smaller websites and apps that you might use.

These companies collect a lot of data about you when you use their services. For example, when you use Google to search for something, they collect information about what you searched for, as well as your location and other information about your device. Similarly, when you use Facebook, they collect information about what you post, who you interact with, and so on.

## Concern
People like us should be concerned that these companies use this data to spy on us or to target us with advertising. Another concern is that these companies share our data with governments or other third parties. While companies generally have privacy policies that prohibit them from sharing our data without our consent, it's possible that they could be compelled to share your data with governments or other organizations through legal means, such as a court order.

It's also important to remember that other parties could also be collecting data about you. For example, your internet service provider (ISP) could be collecting information about the websites you visit, and advertisers could be using cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information about your browsing history.

## Keep in mind
In terms of internet privacy and freedom, the main take away is you should be aware of what data you're sharing and with whom, and to be cautious about giving out too much personal information online. You should also look for ways to protect your privacy, such as using privacy-protecting browser extensions, virtual private networks (VPNs), and encryption to protect your information from being intercepted by third parties and using privacy friendly front-ends and alternatives.

## Conclusion
The internet is a tool that can be used for a wide range of purposes, both positive and negative. And in this modern era of technology, it is true that most of the individuals or organizations use the internet for nefarious purposes, such as surveillance and data collection mostly without user's awareness. So I recommend everyone to look for and use the privacy-protecting open source programs and softwares. You can take a look at the [programs](/programs) that I use to not share any data or share fake date to these spywares.
