## Donations

If you would like to support my work please consider donating.
I'll be utilizing it to setup and maintain a personal home server space for hosting privacy respecting libre software instances. ([Checkout my preference of programs!](/programs))  
I truly appreciate your support and engagement.

I currently only take donations in BTC and XMR.

If you know of another good way to take donations, either in cryptocurrency or traditional banking, please [contact me](/contact/) about adding it.
