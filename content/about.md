Hi, I'm Yogesh Lamichhane, — also known online as <strong>Castor</strong>. I'm a Linux Sysadmin and DevOps Engineer, fascinated by servers, automation, and the beauty of nature.

I've been working with infrastructure and automation since 2022, and I enjoy making systems reliable, secure, and smooth to operate. Whether it's bare-metal servers or cloud-based high availability setups, I thrive on solving real-world problems with clean engineering solutions.

### Experience

#### Freelancer <small>(2022 - present)</small>

Worked with multiple individuals and companies to streamline AWS cloud infrastructure, reduce operational costs, set up CI/CD pipelines, migrate servers, and deploy/configure web applications across various environments.

#### Hyperce <small>(Apr 2024 - Apr 2025)</small>

As a DevOps Engineer, I set up scalable, high-availability cloud infrastructure on AWS, built CI/CD pipelines for over 30 projects, and streamlined development and deployment workflows across the team.


#### Nest Nepal <small>(Jan 2023 - Jan 2024)</small>

Worked as a Server Administrator handling multiple cPanel and DirectAdmin servers on bare metal. Provided technical support for 5,000+ websites, along with full-stack server configuration and system management.
